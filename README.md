# Age Calculator App
This project is an age calculator app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days by submitting a valid date through a form. The app also provides validation errors if any of the fields are empty, if the day number is not between 1-31, if the month number is not between 1-12, if the year is in the future, or if the date is invalid.
